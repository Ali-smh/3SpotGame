## Description

The game is played on a board composed of nine squares, three of which are
designated by a dot, called "spots". Each player, in this two-player
game, controls a colored piece, while a white piece remains
neutral. The goal is to reach 12 points, but with a twist: if
the opponent has obtained at least 6 points, then the one who reaches 12 points
becomes the loser. This introduces a unique strategic dynamic,
forcing players to decide whether to score points, force
the opponent to score, or avoid scoring points.
